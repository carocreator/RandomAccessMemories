            <p> Disappointed?<br> 
                Yes, these memories are random.<br>  
                But isn’t that what you wanted?<br> 
                Yes, these memories are not very specific or not even you.<br> 
                But at the end of the day all memories boil down to a canon of firsts and lasts,<br>  
                to all the things our world considers memorable. <br> 
                And this is what I provide you with: events worth remembering. <br> 
                Don’t fill your brain with unimportant impressions from the past. <br> 
                Even if they are solely yours. <br> 
                Memories have become a currency. <br> 
                Their sentimental value gets bigger the more people can identify with it. <br> 
                <br><br> 
                And by the way:<br> 
                The jungle is life.<br> 
                The water is sex.<br> 
                The wall is death.<br>

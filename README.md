This personality quiz generates memories you didn't know you had.

I wake up.
Iâ€™m not sure if the wolf tricked me with that test. 
Feels like he stole everything that makes me me 
and put me in his mysterious forest 
reselling my story to other people 
who are stupid enough to have themselves talked into a personality test by a wolf or: 
a memory dealer.
